# MetaBlog

This project was undertaken as a challenge.<br>
I discovered Nuxt JS and Strapi.<br>
As a result, the code may not follow the expected standards.<br>
I apologize for this.

During development, I did not concern myself with GitHub.

Backend (Strapi): https://github.com/Morganlth/sparkk-test-metablog-backend
